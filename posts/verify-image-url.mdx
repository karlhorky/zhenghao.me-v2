In a side project I built, I had an input field that let users to pass urls that are supposed to link to image files, and I wanted to add client-side validation for that.

I started with the most obvious solution: regular expressions.

## Regex

A list of common image file types that are supported by most browsers can be found on [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types). I can check if the url ends with one of these filename extensions:

```javaScript
function isImgUrl(url) {
  return /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|webp|avif|gif)$/.test(url)
}
```

However, this assumes all urls must have the correct filename extension appended at the end, which _isn't_ always the case. For example, the url of my [github profile picture](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4) `https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4` links to an image, but it doesn't end up with any image filename extension.

The current solution doesn't cover this edge case.

## Image's onload event

Another approach is to create an image tag `<img >` dynamically in JavaScript and assigning the url to its `src` attribute. If the `onload` event fires off, then that means the browser can correctly decode the image data linked by the url. Thus we know it is indeed an image url.

```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = url;
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    img.onload = () => resolve(true);
    img.onerror = () => resolve(false);
  });
}
```

Now it works with urls that don't have the filename extensions attached.

```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  const img = new Image();
  img.src = url;
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    img.onerror = () => resolve(false);
    img.onload = () => resolve(true);
  });
}

const urls = [
  'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33640448?v=4',
  'https://httpbin.org/image/webp',
  'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/June_odd-eyed-cat.jpg'
];

Promise.all(urls.map((url) => isImgUrl(url))).then(console.log); // [true, true ,true]
```

However, by assigning the `url` to the `src` attribute of an image tag, the browser kicks off a `Get` request to download *the whole image* when we don't plan to actually render anything yet. This solution doesn't scale well if we have hundreds of urls to check.

## Sending HEAD requests and only check for the MIME type

Turns out there is a way to find out if a url links to an image file *without* incurring the cost of downloading. That is, to send a `HEAD` request to get the [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) from the `Content-Type` header.

```jsx
function isImgUrl(url) {
  return fetch(url, {method: 'HEAD'}).then(res => {
    return res.headers.get('Content-Type').startsWith('image')
  })
}
```

This works because all supported image types are nicely grouped under the `image/` MIME type. For example, the MIME type of a `jpeg` file is `image/jpeg` , and for a `png` file it is `image/png` , so we just need to check if the MIME type starts with the word `image`.
